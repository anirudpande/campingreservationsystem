<h2 style="color:red;">Checking In & Out</h2>

<ul style="color:white;">
<li><b>You may check in to your campsite any time after 2 p.m. on your reservation start date.</b></li>

<li>When you arrive, present your reservation voucher or confirmation number and a form of photo identification.</li>

<li>If you arranged for a discount when you made your reservation, proof of eligibility must be shown at this time.</li>

<li>Campsite assignments are made upon your arrival unless your reservation is in a site specific park. If you reserve two sites in a non-site specific park, park staff will try to assign adjacent campsites, subject to availability.</li>

<li>Dogs must be kept on leashes no longer than 6' and in a tent or enclosed vehicle at night. Except for service animals, pets are not allowed in park buildings, on trails, or on most beaches.</li>

<li><b>Check out by noon on your departure date.</b></li>

<li>Please leave the campsite in good condition. The camper who follows you will appreciate it.</li>

</ul>>

<h2 style="color:red;">Cancellation Policy</h2>
<p style="color:white;"><b>The $7.99 reservation fee is non-refundable. </b></p>
<ul style="color:white;">   
<li><b>If you cancel a reservation, a cancellation fee of $7.99 will be assessed per reservation.</b> Cancellations can be made online or by calling our Customer Call Center at (800) 444-PARK (7275).This service is available 7 days a week, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. PST (except New Year’s Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day).</li>

<li><b>If you need to change your arrival/departure date and/or site, you must call our Customer Call Center by 5 p.m. PST the day before your arrival date.</b> A change fee of $7.99 will be assessed per reserved campsite.</li>

<li><b>A campsite will be held for you until 12 p.m. the day after your arrival date. If you have not called the park before that time, you will be considered a "no show" and the park will cancel your reservation.</b> You will be refunded the amount paid for the campsite, less the non-refundable $7.99 reservation fee, the $7.99 cancellation fee, and one night use fee. If you miss your first day but plan to arrive later, you must call the park each day to hold the remainder of your reservation.</li>

<li><b>If you must leave the park one or more days early, a cancellation fee of $7.99 and reservation fee of $7.99 will be assessed per reservation; you must check out before 12 p.m.</b> Retain your camping confirmation letter until you have received your refund or your charge card has been credited. Allow at least 30 days to receive your refund.</li>

<li>If California State Parks closes a campground due to an emergency or disaster, ReserveCalifornia™ will make every effort to notify you. In these cases, all fees will be refunded as soon as possible.</li>

<li>In cases of inclement weather, when the campground remains open, but you choose to leave, refunds will be issued based on the early out policy.</li>
